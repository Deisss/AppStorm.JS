List of server url allowed:


/: get the index html file

/resource/<filename>: get a static resource. See %client%/resource folder
==> special case for *appstorm* wich goes to appstorm folder

/file/list: get file stored

/file/info/<filename>: retrieve basic info (create, modified, checksum, ...)
/file/delete/<filename>: try to delete a file stored

/file/upload: add a file to storage
/file/download/<filename>: retrieve stored file


This allow to create a pretty simple, AND UNSECURE, file server.
